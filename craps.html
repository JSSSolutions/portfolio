        <p><i>Craps, written by John Sowell, desktop DirectX GUI application representation of the casino game of craps. Here, the player is at the craps table, with a number of players playing different strategies. Not only does this game simulate the game of craps, it can also be used as a learning tool as to what strategies the player may want to try, and/or use at an actual casino. The screen shots show the player entering a name, specifying how much to buy in for, placing a bet, and playing the game.</i></p>
