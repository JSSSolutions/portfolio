        <p><i>Disc Connect, written by John Sowell, is a board game desktop GUI application, where the player has a supply of discs that he connects by color on an 8x8 board, scoring points for each connection of 3 to 8 discs of the same color in a row, depending on chosen skill level. Below is the screen, by which the player selects the various playing levels for the game, as well as how many players are to play the game.</i></p>
